Multiple race conditions in drivers/char/adsprpc.c and drivers/char/adsprpc_compat.c in the ADSPRPC driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, allow attackers to cause a denial of service (zero-value write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a COMPAT_FASTRPC_IOCTL_INVOKE_FD ioctl call.
