In the AndroidManifest.xml file defining the SliceBroadcastReceiver handler for com.android.settings.slice.action.WIFI_CHANGED, there is a possible permissions bypass due to a confused deputy. This could lead to local escalation of privilege, allowing a local attacker to change device settings, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
