The bidirectional-text implementation in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not ensure left-to-right (LTR) rendering of URLs, which allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar via crafted right-to-left (RTL) Unicode text, related to omnibox/SuggestionView.java and omnibox/UrlBar.java in Chrome for Android.
