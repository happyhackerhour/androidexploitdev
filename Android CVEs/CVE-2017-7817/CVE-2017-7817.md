A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a page switches to fullscreen mode without user notification, allowing a fake address bar to be displayed. This allows an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use. Note: This attack only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56.
