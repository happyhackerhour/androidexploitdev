An issue was discovered in the Bosch Smart Camera App before 1.3.1 for Android. Due to setting of insecure permissions, a malicious app could potentially succeed in retrieving video clips or still images that have been cached for clip sharing. (The Bosch Smart Home App is not affected. iOS Apps are not affected.)
