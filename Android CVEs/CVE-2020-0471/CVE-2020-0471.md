In reassemble_and_dispatch of packet_fragmenter.cc, there is a possible way to inject packets into an encrypted Bluetooth connection due to improper input validation. This could lead to remote escalation of privilege between two Bluetooth devices by a proximal attacker, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android; Versions: Android-8.0, Android-8.1, Android-9, Android-10, Android-11; Android ID: A-169327567.
