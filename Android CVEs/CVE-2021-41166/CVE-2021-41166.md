The Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. An issue in versions prior to 3.17.1 may lead to sensitive information disclosure. An unauthorized app that does not have the otherwise required `MANAGE_DOCUMENTS` permission may view image thumbnails for images it does not have permission to view. Version 3.17.1 contains a patch. There are no known workarounds.
