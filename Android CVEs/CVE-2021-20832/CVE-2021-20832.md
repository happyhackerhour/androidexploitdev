InBody App for iOS versions prior to 2.3.30 and InBody App for Android versions prior to 2.2.90(510) contain a vulnerability which may lead to information disclosure only when it works with the body composition analyzer InBody Dial. This may allow an attacker who can connect to the InBody Dial with InBody App may obtain a victim's measurement result measured by InBody Dial.
