The QQ application 8.7.1 for Android and iOS does not enforce the permission requirements (e.g., android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) for determining the device's physical location. An attacker can use qq.createMapContext to create a MapContext object, use MapContext.moveToLocation to move the center of the map to the device's location, and use MapContext.getCenterLocation to get the latitude and longitude of the current map center.
