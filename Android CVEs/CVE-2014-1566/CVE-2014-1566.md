Mozilla Firefox before 31.1 on Android does not properly restrict copying of local files onto the SD card during processing of file: URLs, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from the Firefox profile directory via a crafted application. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-1515.
