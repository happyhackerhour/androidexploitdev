Opera Mini for Android allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on .apk file download/installation via an RTLO (aka Right to Left Override) approach, as demonstrated by misinterpretation of malicious%E2%80%AEtxt.apk as maliciouskpa.txt. This affects 44.1.2254.142553, 44.1.2254.142659, and 44.1.2254.143214.
