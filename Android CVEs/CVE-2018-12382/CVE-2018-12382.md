The displayed addressbar URL can be spoofed on Firefox for Android using a javascript: URI in concert with JavaScript to insert text before the loaded domain name, scrolling the loaded domain out of view to the right. This can lead to user confusion. *This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android < 62.*
