The TrustZone kernel, when used in conjunction with a certain Motorola build of Android 4.1.2, on Motorola Razr HD, Razr M, and Atrix HD devices with the Qualcomm MSM8960 chipset does not verify the association between a certain physical-address argument and a memory region, which allows local users to unlock the bootloader by using kernel mode to perform crafted 0x9 and 0x2 SMC operations, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-2596.
