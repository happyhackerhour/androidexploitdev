In computeFocusedWindow of RootWindowContainer.java, and related functions, there is possible interception of keypresses due to focus being on the wrong window. This could lead to local escalation of privilege revealing the user's keypresses while the screen was locked with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android-8.0 Android-8.1 Android ID: A-71786287.
