The logcat_dump_text function in wiretap/logcat.c in the Android Logcat file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not properly handle a lack of \0 termination, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted message in a packet, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3815.
