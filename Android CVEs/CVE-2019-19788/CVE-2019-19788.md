Opera for Android before 54.0.2669.49432 is vulnerable to a sandboxed cross-origin iframe bypass attack. By using a service working inside a sandboxed iframe it is possible to bypass the normal sandboxing attributes. This allows an attacker to make forced redirections without any user interaction from a third-party context.
