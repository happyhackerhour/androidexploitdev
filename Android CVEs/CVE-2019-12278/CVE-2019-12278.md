Opera through 53 on Android allows Address Bar Spoofing. Characters from several languages are displayed in Right-to-Left order, due to mishandling of several Unicode characters. The rendering mechanism, in conjunction with the "first strong character" concept, may improperly operate on a numerical IP address or an alphabetic string, leading to a spoofed URL.
