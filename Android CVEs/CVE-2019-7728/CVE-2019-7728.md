An issue was discovered in the Bosch Smart Camera App before 1.3.1 for Android. Due to improperly implemented TLS certificate checks, a malicious actor could potentially succeed in executing a man-in-the-middle attack for some connections. (The Bosch Smart Home App is not affected. iOS Apps are not affected.)
