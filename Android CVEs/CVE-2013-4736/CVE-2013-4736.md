Multiple integer overflows in the JPEG engine drivers in the MSM camera driver for the Linux kernel 2.6.x and 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, allow attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a large number of commands in an ioctl call, related to (1) camera_v1/gemini/msm_gemini_sync.c, (2) camera_v2/gemini/msm_gemini_sync.c, (3) camera_v2/jpeg_10/msm_jpeg_sync.c, (4) gemini/msm_gemini_sync.c, (5) jpeg_10/msm_jpeg_sync.c, and (6) mercury/msm_mercury_sync.c.
