Untrusted search path vulnerability in the ChainsDD Superuser package 3.1.3 for Android 4.2.x and earlier, CyanogenMod/ClockWorkMod/Koush Superuser package 1.0.2.1 for Android 4.2.x and earlier, and Chainfire SuperSU package before 1.69 for Android 4.2.x and earlier allows attackers to load an arbitrary .jar file and gain privileges via a crafted BOOTCLASSPATH environment variable for a /system/xbin/su process. NOTE: another researcher was unable to reproduce this with ChainsDD Superuser.
