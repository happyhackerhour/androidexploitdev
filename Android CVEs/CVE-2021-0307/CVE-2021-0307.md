In updatePermissionSourcePackage of PermissionManagerService.java, there is a possible automatic runtime permission grant due to a confused deputy. This could lead to local escalation of privilege allowing a malicious app to silently gain access to a dangerous permission with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android; Versions: Android-10, Android-11; Android ID: A-155648771.
