nextcloud news-android is an Android client for the Nextcloud news/feed reader app. In affected versions the Nextcloud News for Android app has a security issue by which a malicious application installed on the same device can send it an arbitrary Intent that gets reflected back, unintentionally giving read and write access to non-exported Content Providers in Nextcloud News for Android. Users should upgrade to version 0.9.9.63 or higher as soon as possible.
