In Car Settings app, the NotificationAccessConfirmationActivity is exported. In NotificationAccessConfirmationActivity, it gets both 'mComponentName' and 'pkgTitle' from user.An unprivileged app can use a malicous mComponentName with a benign pkgTitle (e.g. Settings app) to make users enable notification access permission for the malicious app. That is, users believe they enable the notification access permission for the Settings app, but actually they enable the notification access permission for the malicious app.Once the malicious app gets the notification access permission, it can read all notifications, including users' personal information.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-12LAndroid ID: A-225189301
