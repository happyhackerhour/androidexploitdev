For the Lenovo Smart Assistant Android app versions earlier than 12.1.82, an attacker with physical access to the smart speaker can, by pressing a specific button sequence, enter factory test mode and enable a web service intended for testing the device. As with most test modes, this provides extra privileges, including changing settings and running code. Lenovo Smart Assistant is an Amazon Alexa-enabled smart speaker developed by Lenovo.
