The MPEG4Extractor::parse3GPPMetaData function in MPEG4Extractor.cpp in libstagefright in Android before 5.1.1 LMY48I does not enforce a minimum size for UTF-16 strings containing a Byte Order Mark (BOM), which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (integer underflow and memory corruption) via crafted 3GPP metadata, aka internal bug 20923261, a related issue to CVE-2015-3826.
