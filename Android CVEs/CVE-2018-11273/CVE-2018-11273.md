In all android releases (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) from CAF using the linux kernel, 'voice_svc_dev' is allocated as a device-managed resource. If error 'cdev_alloc_err' occurs, 'device_destroy' will free all associated resources, including 'voice_svc_dev' leading to a double free.
