In addAllPermissions of PermissionManagerService.java, there is a possible permissions bypass when upgrading major Android versions which allows an app to gain the android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION permission without user confirmation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
