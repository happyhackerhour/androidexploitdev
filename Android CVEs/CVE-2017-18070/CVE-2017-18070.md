In wma_ndp_end_response_event_handler(), the variable len_end_rsp is a uint32 which can be overflowed if the value of variable "event->num_ndp_end_rsp_per_ndi_list" is very large which can then lead to a heap overwrite of the heap object end_rsp in all Android releases from CAF (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) using the Linux Kernel.
