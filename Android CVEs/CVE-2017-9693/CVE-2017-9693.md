The length of attribute value for STA_EXT_CAPABILITY in __wlan_hdd_change_station in Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, and QRD Android before 2017-06-06 being less than the actual lenth of StaParams.extn_capability results in a read for extra bytes when a memcpy is done from params->ext_capab to StaParams.extn_capability using the sizeof(StaParams.extn_capability).
