Android 1.5 CRBxx allows local users to bypass the (1) Manifest.permission.CAMERA (aka android.permission.CAMERA) and (2) Manifest.permission.AUDIO_RECORD (aka android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO) configuration settings by installing and executing an application that does not make a permission request before using the camera or microphone.
