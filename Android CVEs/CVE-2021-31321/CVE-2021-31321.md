Telegram Android <7.1.0 (2090), Telegram iOS <7.1, and Telegram macOS <7.1 are affected by a Stack Based Overflow in the gray_split_cubic function of their custom fork of the rlottie library. A remote attacker might be able to overwrite Telegram's stack memory out-of-bounds on a victim device via a malicious animated sticker.
